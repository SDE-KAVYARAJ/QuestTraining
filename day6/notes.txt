-->DATABASE
A database is an organized collection of structured data that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated, typically stored electronically in a computer system.

-->RELATIONAL DATABASE
Relational databases use structured tables with predefined schemas and relationships (e.g., SQL)
Relational databases include MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle

--> NON-RELATIONAL DATABASE
Non-relational databases store data in flexible, schema-less formats like documents, key-value pairs, or graphs (e.g., NoSQL).
Non-relational databases include MongoDB, CouchDB, and Cassandra.

-->PRIMARY KEY
A primary key uniquely identifies each record in a table

-->FOREIGN KEY
A foreign key establishes a relationship between two tables by referencing a primary key.

-->CONSTRAINTS
Constraints enforce rules on the data to maintain integrity and consistency within the database.

 NOT NULL (ensures a column cannot have a NULL value), 
 UNIQUE (ensures all values in a column are distinct), 
 CHECK (validates data against a specified condition), 
 DEFAULT (sets a default value for a column if none is specified),
 FOREIGN KEY (maintains referential integrity between two tables).


-->RELATIONSHIP IN A DATABASE
One-to-One (1:1): Each record in one table corresponds to exactly one record in another table (e.g., a person and their unique identification document).

One-to-Many (1  ): A record in one table can be associated with multiple records in another table (e.g., a teacher can teach multiple classes).

Many-to-Many (M  ): Records in one table can relate to multiple records in another table and vice versa (e.g., students can enroll in multiple courses, and each course can have multiple students).

Many-to-One (M:1): Multiple records in one table can relate to a single record in another table (e.g., many students can belong to one class)
