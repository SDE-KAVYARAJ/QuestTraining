Normalization 
    Normalisation is a process in database design aimed at organizing data to minimize redundancy and improve data integrity. Hereâ€™s a summary of its key concepts and forms:

Key Concepts:
    Functional Dependency: A relationship where one attribute (or set of attributes) uniquely determines another attribute.

    Redundancy: The presence of duplicate data, which can lead to inconsistencies.

    Anomalies: Issues that arise during data operations (insertion, deletion, or updating) due to poor database design.

Normal Forms:
    First Normal Form (1NF):
        Each table has a primary key.
        Each column contains atomic (indivisible) values.
        Each entry in a column is of the same data type.
    
    Second Normal Form (2NF):
        Meets all requirements of 1NF.
        All non-key attributes are fully functionally dependent on the primary key (no partial dependency).
    
    Third Normal Form (3NF):
        Meets all requirements of 2NF.
        There are no transitive dependencies; non-key attributes depend only on the primary key.
    
    Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF):
        A stronger version of 3NF.
        Every determinant is a candidate key.
    
    Fourth Normal Form (4NF):
        Meets all requirements of BCNF.
        No multi-valued dependencies (a situation where one attribute can have multiple values independent of another attribute).

Benefits of Normalization:
    Reduces data redundancy and inconsistency.
    Enhances data integrity and integrity constraints.
    Improves data organization and access speed.
